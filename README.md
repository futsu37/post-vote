## The purpose of the project
Learn how to create readable and scalable backend applications, enhance and polish my current skills. Connect with a developer communnity. Show my dedication and learning abilities.

## Contributions
If you want to help me with this learning journey, I will appreciate your recommendations and/or critique. For the more direct connections, I have all the info pinned on my github profile. Thanks to everyone who decided to help me!

## Current me
I have little to no knowledge on how to write scalable backend applications, never worked in a team with other people, have faith in kind developers that can navigate me on my journey, so I can follow the right path.  I believe that connecting with people is the main way to achieve all of that.
